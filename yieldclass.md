Yield class is an index used in Britain of the potential productivity of even-aged stands of trees. It is based on the maximum mean annual increment of cumulative timber volume achieved by a given tree species growing on a given site and managed according to a standard management prescription.

Yield Class
It is measured
*  in cubic metres / hectare / year
*  in multiples of 2 (even number)
*  i.e. 12, 14, 16, etc.
Example:
*  a crop of yield class 14 is capable of growing an average
of 14 m3/ha/year over its lifetime
Crops should be at least 12 - 15 years old before assessment
*  as all site factors will have come in to play

Yield Class
Sitka spruce
*  Yield Class varies from 14 – 24
*  Greater yields have been achieved
*  Sites that are not considered able to achieve Yield Class 14 with
Sitka spruce are not grant-aided
Lodgepole pine
*  Yield Class varies from 8 – 16
Broadleaves
*  Yield Class varies from 4 - 12
